## Using this repository:

Git and version control are an essential part of software development in general, but for the purposes of this class, we will
use GitHub as a means of distributing class materials as they become available. If you've use Git or version control systems 
before, this guide may be a bit repetitive, but may provide useful in case of any unexpected hiccups.

First, navigate to your working directory. As an example, my working directory is a folder called "BUFN400" in my "Downloads" directory, which I access using the following steps:

1. On the homepage of the respository, and select the green "Code" button. Make sure you're on the "Local" tab, then make sure
that you're on the HTTPS sub-tab. After that, copy the url to your clipboard. The URL should be: https://github.com/sash-wat/BUFN400Fall2023.git
2. Open the command line (Windows) or terminal (Mac)
3. I would do ```cd Downloads``` followed by ```cd BUFN400``` to access the directory where I want to clone this repository.
4. Once in your working directory, run ```git clone [url of the respository]``` and the repository will download to your working directory.

After you download the repository, you'll be able to dynamically pull new content, like homework assignments and notes, as they are posted by the course staff.
